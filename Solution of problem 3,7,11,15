**Problem 3**
Find number of solutions of a linear equation of n variables

Given a linear equation of n variables, find number of non-negative integer solutions of it. For example,let the given equation be “x + 2y = 5”, solutions of this equation are “x = 1, y = 2”, “x = 5, y = 0” and “x = 1. It may be assumed that all coefficients in given equation are positive integers.

**Solution:**
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int countSol(int coeff[], int start,  int end, int rhs) 
{
if (rhs == 0) 
 return 1; 
  int result = 0; 
 for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) 
    if (coeff[i] <= rhs) 
        result += countSol(coeff, i, end  ,rhs - coeff[i]); 
                  return result;
}
// Driver Code

int main() 

{
  int coeff[] = {2, 2, 5}; 
 int rhs = 4; 
    int n = sizeof(coeff) / sizeof(coeff[0]); 
   cout << countSol(coeff, 0, n - 1, rhs); 
  return 0; 
}
